# air-quality-prediction
This example shows how to train a machine learning model to predict air quality based on historical meteorological data (in MATLAB). Then, the predictions are performed on current weather info (in Python) and all code is integrated into a web application. (See "Integrate" directory for examples calling MATLAB from Python and vice versa)

The demo highilghts either deploying as a MATLAB web app or using a RESTful API (combining the MATLAB and Python code in either case)

The example calls out to the Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api

The access key is not provided (ha), but you can get your own for free (backup files are included for example purposes)
